The following is a list of Los Angeles laws involving property and public space.
They are the codes most frequently used to criminalize and disrupt the lives of 
our houseless neighbors, and knowing what they mean and how they’re enforced is 
the first step to dismantling them. A few of the laws mentioned are currently 
vulnerable in court; this is noted in their descriptions. This is not meant to be
taken as legal counsel, and some of the laws may be subject to change (though we
will keep this list updated). I recommend reading the KTOWN For All/Association 
for Responsible and Equitable Public Spending vs. The City of Los Angeles demand
for jury trial document if you need insight into the inhumane and unconstitutional
enforcement of LAMC. 

# LAMC 41.18 Sitting, Lying, Sleeping on Sidewalk


This law is vulnerable due to new court rulings, but it hasn’t been repealed in 
Los Angeles and is still enforceable. LAMC 41.18 makes it illegal to occupy a 
street or sidewalk in a way that blocks the path of or annoys pedestrians. The 
second part of the code bans loitering in a tunnel, subway, anywhere on or around
an overpass, and along any street or highway with cars. The third part prevents 
harassment on the subway, and the final part **prevents sitting, lying, or sleeping
on any street, sidewalk, or public way**. 

# LAMC 63.44(I)(9) Tent on the Beach

This law **prevents camping on beaches** unless it’s a designated campground. It also
**makes it illegal to build a tent on the beach**, which means any shelter that has 
walls and may block the view of the inside. The shelters that don’t have walls, 
like umbrellas or sun shades, must be freestanding and removed before the beach 
closes. “Camping” here means staying on the beach for an extended time, with your
belongings, and sleeping, storing items, making fires, or eating meals there.

# LAMC 41.45 Possession of a Shopping Cart

This law **blocks people from removing shopping carts from a place of business** 
without the owner's consent, and using them for anything other than the owner’s 
intended use. It also prevents any sort of tampering, like removing from the cart
logos or text restating this law. These actions are fineable for up to $50.

# B&P Code 25620 Open Container of Alcohol

This is a state law that makes it **illegal to have open alcohol containers** (anything
with a broken seal or part of the liquid gone) in almost all government-owned public
spaces, such as parks. It doesn’t apply when the containers are collected for the
purpose of recycling. 

# LAMC 41.27(c) Drinking in Public

**Banned drinking locations in Los Angeles County** include streets, sidewalks, 
parks, playgrounds, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and any railroad depot or
bus station; basically, any place open to the public that doesn’t have a liquor 
license. According to another part of the law, you’re also not allowed to drink 
in any of the immediate area surrounding a place with a liquor license: only directly
on the premises.

# LAMC 63.44(B)(24) Smoking in a Park/Bench

This law makes it **illegal to smoke on any property managed by the Los Angeles Parks
and Recreation Department**. These spaces include (but aren’t limited to) public 
parks, roadside rest areas, playgrounds, zoos, oceans, and beaches. 

# LAMC 41.47.2 Urinating in Public

This law **outlaws defecating or urinating on any public property, as well as any 
location where the public would be able to see**. The only places to legally use 
the bathroom are toilets or urinals in restrooms, or temporary bathrooms like 
porta-potties that are designed to be sanitary. 

# LAMC 56.11(3-6) Storage of personal property

Currently, this code is the topic of the lawsuit “Ktown for All and the Assn. for
Responsible and Equitable Public Spending vs. The City of Los Angeles”. It calls
for the city to immediately stop reinforcing 56.11 and for the court to declare 
the law unconstitutional. The fourth amendment guarantees protection from unlawful
search and seizures, and is the foundation of the complaint. The law is also criticized
for its vagueness and sporadic enforcement.  

This law is the basis of the city-wide “sweeps” of homeless encampments. **It shouldn’t
be enforced at all during rain or in weather under 50 degrees; if you observe this,
film the situation and call your city councilperson immediately**. 

The law itself is a long section about the amount of property you’re allowed to 
have, where you can store it, and how. I’m going to explain it in three parts:
1) What are pre-removal and post-removal notices? 2) where you can and can’t have
property, and how the city is allowed to handle it, and 3) how and where to reclaim
property. 

1. What are pre- and post-removal notices?
	* **Pre-removal notices are written warnings to the owner of property that the 
	property is stored in a way that breaks the law**, and needs to moved, or will be 
	removed by the city. Notices may be given directly to the person who owns the 
	property, or will be posted near the property. **However, ‘rapid response’ cleanings
	based on public complaints do not require authorization or notice**.
   		* There’s very important information that must be on the notices: a general
   		description of the property, the location it must be moved from, the date and
   		time the notice was given, and **an address where the items will be stored, with
   		contact information and a website**. 
   		* The notice provides a **24 hour window from the posting of the notice for the
   		items to be moved**, and doesn’t allow them to be moved to another public area.
   		The removal has to happen with 72 hours of them posting the notice. 
   		* Finally, it has to include that LAMC 56.11 was violated, and let the owner
   		know they have 90 days to claim their property. 
	* **Post-removal notices are left near where property has already been removed 
	from**, and must give a description of the property, where it was removed from, and
	at what time. It also must include that LAMC 56.11 was violated, as well as information
	on where to reclaim property and a warning that the owner has 90 days before 
	property is discarded.
	* Neither pre- or post-removal notices are required in certain situations, and 
	the notice rules for each situation are underlined below. 
2. How and where can property be stored? 
	* You can’t store any items on public property and leave them there **unattended**. 
	(*pre- and post-removal notice*) 
	* You also can't have **more property than would fit in a standard 60 gallon trash
	can, attended or not**. That’s considered “Excess Personal Property”. (*pre- and 
	post-removal notice*) 
	* There’s also rules for **where you can’t store any property**. These are: blocking
	the sidewalk so that there’s less than 3 feet for someone to get by (because of 
	the American Disabilities Act), within 10 feet of a loading dock, driveway, 
	entrance or exit, and anywhere with a posted closing time if it’s there after 
	hours. (*post-removal notice only*)
	*  If your property is a **health hazard, blocks street sweeping, is illegal, or 
	is connected to a crime**, it may be removed with no notice. (*no pre- or post-removal
	notice*)
	* You can’t store “bulky items” on public property, **or any single item that won’t
	won’t fit in a 60 gallon trash can**. This does not include constructed tents, 
	wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, or bikes. (*no pre- or post-removal notice*).
	* But, **if the bulky item(s) is a shelter** and does not break any of the rules in 
	the 3rd or 4th points, they have to give pre-removal notice. (*pre-removal notice*) 

3. How can property be reclaimed? 
	* Unless your property is illegal or connected to a crime, blocked street sweeping,
	or is a health hazard, the city is required to store your property for 90 days 
	before it’s discarded.
	* **The information about the place your property is stored at must be included on
	all pre- and post-removal notices**.
	* There are ways to **claim property without needing government identification**, 
	such as giving the date, time, and location the property was removed from and 
	describing the property in a detailed way.

# LAMC 56.11(7,8) Ban on daytime tents

These two sections have to do with when you can have a tent up, and how you can 
secure it. **Tents aren’t allowed to be up between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.** on public
property, unless it’s raining or the temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. 
If your tent is up during these hours, the city may impound the tent without any 
notice, but must give a post-removal notice (*post-removal only*). However, the laws
I described before about where you’re not allowed to store any property, as well 
as the law about hazards or illegal items, still apply here. The **section after 
prevents anyone from securing their property by attaching it in some way to public
property**, like with rope or string, or to private property in a way that blocks 
the street. The city is allowed to remove anything used to attach the property 
with no notice. 

# Cal. Veh. Code 21954 Pedestrian in Roadway

This law **requires pedestrians in the roadway to move for cars**, unless the pedestrian
is in a crosswalk. It also adds that the warning to pedestrians doesn’t prevent 
drivers from being held accountable for driving unsafely. 

# Cal. Veh. Code 21456 Pedestrian in Crosswalk

This is an explanation of **proper use of crosswalks**: you may cross when it says 
“walk”, has a walking person image displayed, or has a countdown displayed with 
enough time to complete the crossing before “0”. Don’t begin crossing if only a 
flashing “Don’t walk” or red hand image are displayed. 

# Cal. Penal Code 374.4 Littering

This law outlines a **three-strike fine rule for any littering**, and the possibility
of a minimum 8 hours of community service. Littering is dropping any small quantity 
of trash, like plastic food or drink packaging, anywhere outside of proper trash 
containers. It applies to public and private property, unless you own the property
and the waste isn’t a hazard. The fines are ranged: $250-$1,000 for the first 
violation, $500-$1,500 for the second, and $750-$3,000 for the third.
